\n  \n    ¿Cómo se calcula tu salud financiera?\n    Existen cuatro componentes de tu salud financiera que son reflejo de tus actividades en tu día a día. Lo que realizas en relación con tus gastos, ahorros, deudas y tu planeación impacta en el cómo puedes sobreponerte ante alguna adversidad. También impacta en tu habilidad para conseguir tus objetivos. Cada componente se mide a través de dos subcomponentes:\n    \n      \n        \n        Gastos\n        \n          En cuanto a gastos, los medidores de salud son que tus gastos sean inferiores a tus ingresos, logrando pagar a tiempo y por completo tus cuentas. ¡Gasta menos de lo que  ganas!\n          Cuando hablamos en gastar menos que tus ingresos, hacemos énfasis sobre cuánto ganas mensualmente, y cuánto estás empleando para pagar tus gastos diarios, y finalmente el pago de tus deudas. Es importante tenerlo en cuenta, debido a que la habilidad que puede tener una persona para administrar con éxito su dinero, el hábito de gastar menos que sus ingresos, son comportamientos que afectan directamente la capacidad de ahorro y no lo lleva a ser tan vulnerable ante situaciones inesperadas.\n          En relación con tus pagos a tiempo y por completo, saber qué tan bien las personas se mantienen al tanto de sus cuentas, es el punto de partida para saber si administran su flujo de efectivo de manera correcta y cómo sobrellevan los compromisos financieros que adquieren diariamente.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        Ahorro\n        \n          Tener suficiente liquidez es una de las medidas más importantes para saber sobre si tu nivel de ahorro es saludable. Ésto lo conocemos a través cuánto dinero tienes ahorrado en una cantidad determinada de meses en el que podrías vivir manteniendo tu estilo de vida. Un nivel saludable es tener más de 6 meses ahorrado, así como destinar al menos un 30% de tu ingreso para el ahorro.\n          También es importante tomar conciencia sobre si se tienen activos y ahorros a largo plazo. Tener ahorros suficientes a largo plazo es necesario para alcanzar la seguridad financiera y tomar ventaja sobre las oportunidades en como invertir en una casa, por ejemplo. También posibilita tener cubierto el retiro y además tener activos, construyendo un ahorro saludable para alcanzar todas tus metas.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        Deuda\n        \n          Para saber si el componente de deuda es saludable, una de las partes que lo componen es si se tiene una deuda sostenible. Se mide como la razón entre tus ingresos y tu nivel de deuda. Por ejemplo, una deuda se considera sostenible si la razón es menor al 36%.\n          El tener una deuda sostenible hace que en un futuro no te veas agobiado por pagos que estén por venir, o que tengas sobre endeudamiento lo cual te puede llevar a dificultades financieras o bancarrota.\n          Como consecuencia de lo anterior, una de las marcas importantes en la parte de deuda es contar con un excelente score crediticio, que aunque no se consideran como un determinante de salud financiera, indican la capacidad que tiene una persona de adquirir un crédito y qué tan propenso es de pagar las deudas que adquiere.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        Planificación\n        \n          La planificación se refiere a constatar que hay dos indicadores que sugieren si tu salud financiera en ese track es la adecuada.\n          El primer indicador es contar con los seguros apropiados, es decir, estar cubierto completamente antes un potencial percance. Esto permite que una persona sea resiliente al momento de enfrentarse a gastos inesperados, como quizá un accidente automovilístico o una emergencia médica.\n          Por otro lado, un claro indicador la planificación es tener comportamientos que indican que planea sus gastos o movimientos financieros. Por ejemplo, llevar el control de sus gastos, contar con un plan de retiro o con un plan de ahorro. En general, a partir de un estudio realizado por “Centre For Financial Services Innovation” dice que el planear con anticipación está íntimamente relacionado con salud financiera dado que se tiene un control de sus finanzas.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    calculation-explanation.style.scss\n                \n                @import 'app-colors';\nsection{\n  z-index: 5;\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background-color: rgba(52,70,83,0.9);\n  overflow: auto;\n  padding: 88px 88px 0 88px;\n  .close{\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 18px;\n    height: 18px;\n    top: 32px;\n    right: 32px;\n    .cross{\n      position: relative;\n      display: inline-block;\n      width: 20px;\n      height: 20px;\n      overflow: hidden;\n      cursor: pointer;\n      &::before, &::after {\n        content: '';\n        position: absolute;\n        width: 100%;\n        top: 50%;\n        left: 0;\n        margin-top: -1px;\n        background: $white;\n        height: 1px;\n      }\n      &::before {\n        transform: rotate(45deg);\n      }\n      &::after {\n        transform: rotate(-45deg);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  .content{\n    width: 100%;\n    max-width: 848px;\n    margin: 0px auto 110px auto;\n    padding: 50px 0px 72px 0px;\n    background-color: $white;\n    .title{\n      font-size: 24px;\n      font-weight: 100;\n      color: $text-black;\n      &.modal_title{\n        padding-left: 28px;\n      }\n      &.item_title{\n        margin-top: 24px;\n      }\n    }\n    .explanation{\n      font-size: 14px;\n      color: $text-gray;\n      font-weight: 300;\n    }\n    .principal{\n      margin-top: 64px;\n      padding: 0px 122px 0px 88px;\n    }\n    .items{\n      width: 100%;\n      margin-top: 64px;\n      .item{\n        width: calc(100% - 176px);\n        display: block;\n        margin: 0px auto;\n        padding-bottom: 56px;\n        padding-right: 108px;\n        &:not(:nth-child(1)){\n          margin-top: 40px;\n        }\n        &:not(:last-child){\n          border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(151,151,151,0.4);\n        }\n        img{\n          width: 54px;\n        }\n        .explanations_list{\n          margin-top: 24px;\n          .explanation{\n            &:not(:nth-child(1)){\n              margin-top: 16px;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '              ¿Cómo se calcula tu salud financiera?
